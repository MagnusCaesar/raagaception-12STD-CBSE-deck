If you are new to this deck, or Anki in general, I highly recommend reading through my <a href="https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck#getting-started">Getting Started tutorial</a>.

<strong>! ! ! DISCLAIMER ! ! !</strong>
If you are updating from v0.x.x to v1.x.x, you need to install the deck via a CrowdAnki import to implement the new deck structure. The legacy tag stucture has been abandoned. <a href="https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck#updating-to-a-new-version-of-the-deck">This section</a> of the GitHub ReadMe explains how to do that.
