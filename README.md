## Downloads
### For new users
1) Download the Anki program for desktop from [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2) Download the latest version of the deck from the [latest release changelog](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases/latest).
3) Double-click the downloaded file and it will open up within the Anki.
4) You can either use Anki's [filtered decks feature](https://docs.ankiweb.net/filtered-decks.html?highlight=filtered#filtered-decks--cramming) to study selective chapters from the deck, or just suspend all the cards after downloading and selectively unsuspend cards by tag as illustrated in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iYU-5nXvCrA). 
I will eventually be making a detailed tutorial of my own, when I have the time.
### For existing users
***WARNING : Make sure you never ever, under any circumstance, rename or rearrange the deck you download from here, otherwise it will hamper the update process. And always make a profile backup before installing any updates!***

If you already are using previous version of the deck, just download the [latest release](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases/latest) and double-click it on a desktop system. You don't need to delete or alter anything for updating; Anki will automatically open and add the cards from the new release into your existing version without affecting anything else. 

## Tag Structure
This deck follows the special reduced [CBSE 2021 syllabus](http://cbseacademic.nic.in/Revisedcurriculum_2021.html#collapse15), and is tagged accordingly.
