# Raagaception's 12STD CBSE Deck
The ultimate Anki deck for preparing for Grade 12 CBSE Board Exams in India!

## For new users
Download the latest version of the release from [here](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases) *(scroll down and expand the "assets" dropdown, then download the .apkg file)*.

## For existing users
If you have a previous version, just download the latest release and double-click it. You don't need to delete or alter anything for updating; Anki will automatically open and add the cards from the new release into your existing version without affecting anything else. I post updates every alternate day at 8:30 pm IST.

## Why isn't this shared on Anki Shared Decks?
This deck will only be uploaded on the Anki Shared website when v1.0.0 is ready. It is still a work in progress; expected to be complete by 10th May 2021.
