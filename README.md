The **ultimate** Anki deck for preparing for Grade 12 CBSE Board Exams in India!

## Downloads
#### For new users
1) Download the Anki program for desktop from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2) Download the latest version this deck from [releases](https://github.com/Raagaception/raagaception-12STD-CBSE-deck/releases/latest) *(expand the "assets" drop down, then download the .apkg file)*, or from the **[AnkiWeb shared deck page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1981482084).**
3) Double-click the downloaded file and it will open up within the Anki.
4) You can either use Anki's [filtered decks feature](https://docs.ankiweb.net/filtered-decks.html?highlight=filtered#filtered-decks--cramming) to study selective chapters from the deck, or just suspend all the cards after downloading and selectively unsuspend cards by tag as illustrated in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iYU-5nXvCrA). 
I will eventually be making a detailed tutorial of my own, when I have the time.
#### For existing users
If you have a previous version, just download the latest release and double-click it. You don't need to delete or alter anything for updating; Anki will automatically open and add the cards from the new release into your existing version without affecting anything else.
